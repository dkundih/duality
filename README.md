**For whom is duality made for?**

duality is a Python package for Data science and Machine learning, designed to aid researchers and engineers to meet their goals with small effort.

**Why duality?**

duality disrupts the monotone world of data and gives it meaning.

**Is duality free to use?**

duality is completely free of charge for both personal and commercial use, but only under the conditions stated in the license. Developing such a complex module isn't easy and takes a lot of time and knowledge in several fields of science such as statistics, programming and domain knowledge, so any donation at https://patreon.com/dkundih or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dkundih in order to keep duality free is more than welcome.

**Who stands behind duality?**

The module itself, it's maintenance, updates and stability, logo, videos, promotional materials and everything associated with duality are done by **David Kundih** from **Croatia**.
